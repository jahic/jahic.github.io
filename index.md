        <p> Currently, I am working as a <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jj542/"> research assistant </a> in the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/comparch/">Computer Architecture Group</a> run by <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tmj32/">Timothy M. Jones</a> at University of Cambridge.
        I did my PhD with topic "Supervised Testing of Embedded Concurrent Software" in 
                    <a href="https://ems.eit.uni-kl.de/en/staff/jasmin-jahic/">Microelectronic Systems Design group</a> 
                    and <a href="http://agse3.informatik.uni-kl.de/"> Software Engineering Chair: Dependability department</a> at 
                    <a href="https://www.uni-kl.de/en/">University of Kaiserslautern</a>.
        For 7 and a half years, I was working as a researcher and a project manager in Embedded Software department at <a href="https://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/"> Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering</a>. 
            Also, I'm a tutor at <a href="https://www.uni-kl.de/en/">University of Kaiserslautern</a> and I was a coordinator of <a href="http://em-se.eu/">European Master Program in Software Engineering</a> for <a href="https://www.uni-kl.de/en/">University of Kaiserslautern</a>

                My research interests include high-performance concurrent computing, engineering and software architecture of concurrent embedded systems, 
                improving living conditions using low-power embedded systems, and application of AI in Software Engineering.
